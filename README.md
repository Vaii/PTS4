Proftaak semester 4 software engineering.


Project Description:

The client requested a system that will be used for planning different trainings that their employees or external trainees can attend.
The current system is split up in two parts; 
One part where the external contacts book their trainings and one part where the employees request to attend a training.

The goal is to create a system which combine these two components into one.

The following features should be implemented into the system
  - Employees can manage trainings / training data / suppliers and teachers.
  - Teachers can see the trainging schedule.
  - Teachers van see the list of attendees for a training.
  - Employees can see a list of avaiable trainings and sign up by using a training cost form or their sign status for a           specific training.
  - External trainees can see a list of available trainings and training data and sign up for a training.
  - Business Unit managers can see the trainings employees have signed up for and accept or decline these signings.
